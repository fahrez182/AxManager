**AxManager** is a system management tool designed to provide deeper control over Android applications and system settings.

Unlike traditional "Managers" like KernelSU that strictly require rooting, AxManager is built with a **Non-Root / ADB-First** philosophy. It allows users to execute shell commands and manage system parameters using Wireless Debugging or Shizuku, while still allowing execution with **Root access** if available.

**Features**
- **Shell Executor:** Run shell commands directly from the app. Supports ADB/Non-Root execution and seamlessly switches to Root execution if available.
- **Plugin System:** Manage third-party modules to extend device functionality without modifying the system partition and without root access.
- **WebUI:** Execute shell commands using a web-based interactive interface. [Learn More](https://fahrez182.github.io/AxManager/plugin/what-is-plugin.html)

**Why AxManager?**
- **No Root Required:** Fully functional on locked bootloaders or devices where banking apps must remain intact.
- **Universal Compatibility:** Usable on a wider range of devices compared to root-only managers.
- **Safe & Reversible:** Since it operates largely via ADB shell, changes are generally less risky than modifying the system partition.

**Notices & Credits**  
This project is open-source and includes adapted code from reputable projects to handle Android IPC and ADB permissions:

- **[Magisk](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk):** Inspiration for BusyBox and Module handling.
- **[Shizuku](https://github.com/RikkaApps/Shizuku) / [API](https://github.com/RikkaApps/Shizuku-API):** Utilized for ADB/Permission handling logic. (Apache 2.0)
- **[KernelSU](https://github.com/tiann/KernelSU) / [Next](https://github.com/KernelSU-Next/KernelSU-Next):** Inspiration for the UI/UX design.

*AxManager is an independent project and is not affiliated with Shizuku or KernelSU.*
